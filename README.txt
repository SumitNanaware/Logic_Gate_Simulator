PROJECT NAME: LOGIC_GATE_SIMULATOR

DESCRIPTION:
	Logic Gate Simulator is an application used to simulate logical expression using logic gates.
	the adjoining project is the logic gate simulator, which helps the user to apply various inputs and check its corresponding outputs.
	The Toggle buttons of the gate who is not connected to any other gate as input are the actual inputs.
	thereafter by recursive function calls the value of each Node in the circuit is set.
	note that the togglebuttons of the gates connected to some other input are inactive.

	This project uses the information got by the successive clicks, 
	User has to take care that Source is entered prior to Destination while connecting the gates and led.
	
	Gates implemented are: AND, OR, NOT, NAND, NOR, XOR, XNOR
